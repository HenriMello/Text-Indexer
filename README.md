# Text-Indexer
In this project, we will build a text indexer using Binary Search Trees (BST). Binary search trees are data structures that allow for efficient data storage and retrieval, using hierarchical data organization strategies. A BST is formed by a connected set of elements (which we call nodes). Each node in a BST has references to two other nodes, one to the left and one to the right.
The fundamental property of a BST is that, for every node X in the tree, its nodes to the left have values ​​smaller than X. Similarly, its nodes to the right have values ​​greater than X.
The goal of this work is to build a text indexing system that performs data storage and retrieval using binary search trees.
